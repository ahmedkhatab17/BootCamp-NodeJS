Day 1: Variables and Data Types

 Learn:
o Understanding variable declarations (let, const, var)
o Different data types in JavaScript (string, number, boolean, null, undefined,
symbol)
o Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

 Focus:
o Use of variables and data types in code
o Type coercion concepts
o How to perform operations and comparisons
o Understanding operator precedence

 Tasks:
o Research and list the differences between let, const, and var.
o Write a code snippet using each variable declaration and log them to the
console.
o Experiment with type coercion by combining different data types in
operations and log the results.
o Research and create a table of arithmetic, comparison, and logical
operators in JavaScript.
o Write code snippets that demonstrate the use of each type of operator.
o Implement a program that checks whether a number is even or odd using
comparison operators.
o Write a program that compares two strings and logs if they are equal,
using logical operators.
